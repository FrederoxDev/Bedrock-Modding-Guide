# 2.1 - Hello World

We will now make a simple mod which will print a simple "Hello World" into the console, when the mod is loaded by Zenova

1. In Visual Studio open up `Example.cpp` and replace the contents of that file with:
```cpp
#include "Zenova.h"
#include "generated/initcpp.h"

MOD_FUNCTION void ModStart() {
	Zenova_Info("Hello World!");
}
```

2. Next open the project up in file explorer, find the `maps` folder and open up `SymbolMap.json` and replace the content with an empty object.
```json
{}
```

3. Next build the project using `Ctrl + Shift + B` or under the `Build` tab and select `Build Solution`

4. Finally open up ZenovaLauncher, and create a profile for `1.14.60.5`. Configure the profile and select `Template Name` and add it to the profile. If everything has worked, click play in the launcher and watch the command line and you will see:
```
[Info] [ModStart] Hello World!
```
