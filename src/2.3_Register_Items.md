# 2.3 - Registering Items

Firstly replace your code in `src/Example.cpp` with this, as it will be build upon throughout this page.
```cpp
#include "Zenova.h"
#include "generated/initcpp.h"
#include "Minecraft/Items/VanillaItems.h"
#include "Minecraft/Items/Item.h"
#include "Minecraft/Items/ItemRegistry.h"

MOD_FUNCTION void ModStart() {}
```

## VanillaItems::registerItems

1. When registering an item, you will need to hook into the `VanillaItems::registerItems` function. Navigate to `registerItems` in `Minecraft/Items/VanillaItems.h`
```cpp
static void registerItems(bool);
```

<br />

2. Next as this is a static function, the hook and trampoline only need to have the parameters from `registerItems`, unline VHook which also took the class as a pointer. Try to define them yourself first, and then compare against the example
```cpp
// Hover and select the eye to reveal the solution
@inline static void (*_registerItems)(bool);
@static void registerItems(bool flag) 
@{
@    // Call the trampoline so that minecraft can register it's own items first
@    _registerItems(flag);
@
@    // Print to console to see when it is called
@    Zenova_Info("registerItems");
@}
```

<br />

3. Add the hook to your `ModStart` function. Try to do this yourself and then reveal the hidden code. After this, build your project and open a world, it will show that `registerItems` is only called during the world load, and not when the game is opened.
```cpp
// Hover and select the eye to reveal the solution
@MOD_FUNCTION void ModStart() 
@{
@	Zenova_Hook(VanillaItems::registerItems, &registerItems, &_registerItems);
@}
```

<br />

4. Now modify your hook for `registerItems`, to register an individual item you can use `ItemRegistry::registerItem` after calling the trampoline function. `registerItem` takes in a generic type, for now use the `Item` class. Additionally it takes in a `const std::string&` for the identifier of the item and also a `short` for the item number id.
```cpp
static void registerItems(bool flag)
{
	_registerItems(flag);
	ItemRegistry::registerItem<Item>("guide:test_item", ItemRegistry::getMaxItemID());
}
```

<br />

5. Build the project and open a world, open the chat and run `/give @s guide:test_item`. The item should show up in the list however it will not have an icon yet
