# Adding headers

Now that we have made a simple hello world program, we want to be able to start interacting with Minecraft. To do this we recreate the header files that the game uses, for now we will just use premade headers to save work. At later points in this guide you will learn how to start making your own headers, so that you can work with parts of the game that have not yet had headers made for.


## Using FrederoxDev/BedrockHeaders

This is a public repository which contains community made header files and symbol maps. Firstly start a command line prompt inside of your `Template` folder and run:
```ps
git submodule add https://github.com/FrederoxDev/BedrockHeaders
```

This will add the repository as a git submodule so that you are able to use the files inside of the repo. Next close the project in Visual studio and run
```ps
rmdir /s /q maps
rmdir /s /q build
```

We will then open the `CMakeLists.txt` and edit two lines to change the path for your header files and symbol maps.
- Change `set(IncludeDir inc)` into `set(IncludeDir BedrockHeaders/inc)`
- Change `set(maps_directory "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/maps")` into `set(maps_directory "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/BedrockHeaders/maps")`


## Regenerating the project with CMake

1. Open up the CMake Gui tool. Next set the source code location to your new `Template` folder, next set the build location to `Template/build` (Make sure to include the full path).

2. In the bottom left hit configure, set the `Optional platform` to `x64`, and press `Finish` and wait for it to finish.

3. Next click `Generate` and then `Open Project`, this will then open inside of Visual Studio.
