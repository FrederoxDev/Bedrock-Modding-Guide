# Introduction

In this guide it will be assumed that you have existing knowledge in programming. You do not specifically need c++ knowledge, but it would be good to understand the concepts in programming. 

As a disclaimer, modding bedrock is *hard*, especially if you have no experience in reverse engineering, but don't let that put you down trying. It can be helpful to see many concepts in modding as a "black box", meaning that you have enough knowledge to use them, but without understanding exactly why it works. You can always come back later at a point where you are more used to the concepts to grasp why it works if you want a more deep understanding.
