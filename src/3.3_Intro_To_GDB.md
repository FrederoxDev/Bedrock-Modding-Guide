# 3.3 - Intro to GDB

The GNU Debugger can be used to find `Member Variables, Enums and Structs` from the `Linux Server`. To get started you will need to install the `Ubuntu` distro through `Windows Subsystem for Linux`, you can find a guide for this on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)


## Installing GDB

1. Open Ubuntu and run `sudo apt-get install gdb`
2. To open GDB run `gdb`

## Loading the Linux Server

1. Use the `file "<path>"` command to load the `bedrock_server` file in the `Linux Server`. To access your files on Windows you can do this through the `/mnt/c/` directory. 

> Example: If your files path on Windows was `C:/Users/User/Documents/Ubuntu Server/bedrock_server` you would use the path `"/mnt/c/Users/User/Documents/Ubuntu Server/bedrock_server"`

2. Next run `set pagination off` to disable GDB from pausing while printing


## ptype Command

- You can use the `ptype` command to find the `member variables` of a class. For example for the Item class you would run `ptype Item` and it would print all of the member variable types and names.

- You can also use the `ptype` command to find the values of an enum. For example for the enum CreativeItemCategory, you would run `ptype CreativeItemCategory`.

- You can also use the `ptype` command to print a struct. For example for the CreativeGroupInfo struct you would run `ptype CreativeGroupInfo`
